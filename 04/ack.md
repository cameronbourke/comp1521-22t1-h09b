I begin today by acknowledging that I am hosting
this tutorial from the unceded lands of the Gadigal people.

I also acknowledge the Traditional Custodians of the various lands
on which many of you are joining from today.

I would like to pay my respects to Elders past and present and
extend that respect to any Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
peoples here today.
