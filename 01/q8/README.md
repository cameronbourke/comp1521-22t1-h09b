Q8
==========================================

What are `mipsy`, `spim`, `qtspim` & `xspim`?

> Why no compile step?

[ ] Run `./i_love_mips.s` with each.

- Remeber that you need to run `mipsy` and `spim`
  on the CSE machines as follows:
  ```bash
  $ 1521 mipsy 
  ```

> Note! Autotest will always use `spim` in 22T1.
