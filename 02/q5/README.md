Q5

Translate this C program so it uses goto rather than if/else.
Then translate it to MIPS assembler.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int x, y;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &x);

    if (x > 46340) {
        printf("square too big for 32 bits\n");
    } else {
        y = x * x;
        printf("%d\n", y);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

While I personally enjoy translating `C` -> `MIPS`,
it's time to let you have a go!

After the time has elapsed, we'll get started
with the lab, and I'll give feedback to each team!
