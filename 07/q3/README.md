Q3
==========================================

Give a representation for each of the following
decimal values in `16-bit` twos-complement bit-strings.

**Positive Example**

	1000

If the number is positive, it is no different!
Simply convert from decimal to binary as we
have been doing.

**Negative Example**

This is where things get a little more involved!

Let's say we want to find the twos complement
for the decimal value:

	-100 

The steps are:

1. Convert the magnitude to binary
2. Flip the bits (find the ones complement)
3. Add one (now it's the two complement)
